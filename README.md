**The difference between Docker and a Virtual Machine:**

Docker runs containers, which are run natively on Linux and share the kernel of the host machine with other containers.
A Vitual Machine runs as an entire guest operating system, using the virtual resources of its host. 
A container is therefore much more lightweight than a VM, and can be started in just seconds, while a VM can take minutes to spin up.
A VM provides full OS isolation with guaranteed resources, while Docker just isolate one process from another.
